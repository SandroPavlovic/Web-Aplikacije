			Unbound is the biggest gravel race of the season and has massively influenced the scene as a whole. With that in mind, we expect many other races will follow suit with similar rules.

        <p>Aero bars have been banned from the elite fields of Unbound.
			Many gravel racers use extensions because they can offer a significant aerodynamic advantage. They also offer an additional riding position, which can reduce fatigue when covering long distances.
			However, some racers and organisers perceive aero bars as unsafe, particularly when riding in a group because riders must move from the extensions and onto the bars to access the brake levers.
			Previous winners in both the men’s and women’s Unbound fields – including 2022 men’s winner, Ivar Slik – have used aero bars. Mat Stephens even credited his 2017 Unbound victory to them.</p>
		
		<p>
			However, others, including 2021 men’s winner Ian Boswell, have proven they aren’t necessary to win.
			Riders tipped to win the 2022 edition of the race (including Boswell) tried to reach a collective commitment to not use aero bars, but felt a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ wasn’t enough, and called on race promoters to create clear rules.
			Outside of Unbound, aero bars have already been banned at other Life Time (Unbound’s promoter) events, including Crusher in the Tushar.

            Though not explicitly outlawed in the UCI Gravel World Series’ regulations, aero bars are banned from UCI-regulated road cycling events. Article 1.3.022 states “the attachment of any additional handlebar component or extension is prohibited”.
